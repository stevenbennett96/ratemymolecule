# Rate My Molecule:

Software package for predicting synthetic accesibility of organic molecules. The tools are deployed as a Flask webapp, using PostgreSQL database. The website is currently hosted at [ratemymolecule.ml](wwww.ratemymolecule.ml).

This code was developed by Steven Bennett, while undergoing my PhD in the Jelfs group, [jelfs-group.org](http://www.jelfs-group.org/).
